- A little project for understanding swoole a little better. Deployed application is at [https://portfolio.chat.luizdudu.com/]
- For running the application you'll need php 8.3 and swoole extension installed and that's why there is a docker for easy usage.
- After docker is installed you can run `sh console/bin/start-container` and you will have everything ready for the development
